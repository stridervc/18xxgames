This is the source code for http://18xxgames.info

Goals
=====
The goal of 18xxgames.info is to be a quick reference for 18xx
games.
It should aid in setup and as a reminder of rules differences
between different 18xx games.
It should be as simple as possible while being useful.
It should be browseable from a phone.

Conributing
===========
If you would like to contribute, please fork this code and create
a pull request. The best way to contribute is to add information
to games, or creating entries for games which aren't listed yet.

See the Games section for more information on how to contribute
information on games.

Games
=====
All games are in the games directory. Each game should be its own
file, with the filename being the name of the game, followed by
".lua". These files are Lua tables, but it is not necessary to
know Lua to use them.

"games/1889.lua" is the most complete at the moment. It should
serve as a good reference for creating other games.
